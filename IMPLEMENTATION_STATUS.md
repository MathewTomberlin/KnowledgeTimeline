**Local Component End-to-End Testing is now READY!** 

We have successfully implemented and integrated all the core components required for local component end-to-end testing:

✅ **Memory Storage Pipeline**: Complete implementation of KnowledgeObjectService and MemoryStorageService  
✅ **Chat Flow Integration**: ChatController now triggers memory extraction and storage after LLM responses  
✅ **Service Integration**: All services properly wired and tested  
✅ **Data Flow Validation**: Complete flow from user message → LLM response → memory extraction → storage → relationship discovery  

**What This Means**: You can now test the complete application flow with live local data. The system will:
1. Receive user messages through the ChatController
2. Process them through the LLM service
3. Automatically extract memories from the conversation
4. Store them as knowledge objects with proper relationships
5. Update session state and trigger background processing

**Next Steps**: You can now run the application locally and test the complete end-to-end flow by sending chat messages and observing the memory storage pipeline in action.
